## Overview

torontodata is a very simple package that makes it a little easier to
access the Toronto City Council API that The Toronto City Website itself
uses. It is by no means comprehensive, and only provides access to
endpoints that I was able to locate. As far as I know, the is no public
documention of the API, and this use of it has not been sanctioned or
endorsed by the City of Toronto. It is not in any way affiliated with
The City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal. See <https://open.toronto.ca/>
for the officialopen data portal.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("torontodata")

```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you
can install the development version of dplyr from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mduvekot/torontodata")
```
